    "Memory Overhead:\n",
    "HashMap: HashMap generally has a lower memory overhead compared to TreeMap because it does not store the keys in a sorted order.\n",
    "TreeMap: TreeMap requires additional memory to maintain the sorted order of the keys using a balanced binary search tree. This can result in higher memory consumption, especially for large collections.\n",
    "Choosing between HashMap and TreeMap depends on the specific requirements of your use case. If you need a fast and unordered collection of key-value pairs, HashMap is a suitable choice. If you require a sorted collection or need to perform operations like range queries or finding the next/previous key, TreeMap is a better option.'''"
